# PROJECT BRIEF — TEMPLATE
> Version: *[version label, e.g. "Jam v1"]*
> Target: *[build environment, e.g. "Build entirely with Claude Code inside VS Code"]*
> Style Goal: *[one-sentence creative direction]*

## 1) PRODUCT GOAL
*What are we making? Define the core fantasy in 3-5 bullet points. What does the player/user experience?*

**Core fantasy:**
- *Bullet 1*
- *Bullet 2*
- *Bullet 3*

**Success criteria:**
- *Measurable target 1 (e.g. average session length)*
- *Measurable target 2 (e.g. restart time)*
- *Feel target (e.g. "failure always feels fair")*

**Non-goals (important):**
- *What we are NOT building — prevents scope creep*

---

## 2) TECH STACK & PROJECT STRUCTURE
**Tech:**
- *Engine/framework*
- *Language*
- *Build tool*
- *Optional server/backend*

**Project structure:**
```
project-root/
  index.html
  src/
    main.ts
    scenes/
    systems/
    config/
    util/
  public/
    assets/
```

**Dev environment:**
- *IDE*
- *AI assistant*

---

## 3) CORE LOOP
*The central gameplay/interaction loop. Numbered steps from start to end, then repeat.*

1. *Step 1*
2. *Step 2*
3. *...*

**Flow:** *Title → Start → Play → End → Results → Title (repeat)*

---

## 4) CONTROLS
*Most important feel section. How does the user interact? What inputs map to what actions?*

**Control goal:**
- *Philosophy of how controls should feel*

**Input sources:**
- *Primary input (e.g. mouse, touch, keyboard)*
- *Secondary inputs*

**Movement model:**
- *How input translates to on-screen movement*

**Fail/boundary logic:**
- *What causes failure related to input/control*

---

## 5) CORE SYSTEM A
*Replace with the name of your first major system (e.g. "Road System", "Level System", "World System")*

**Concept:**
- *What this system does*

**Responsibilities:**
- *What it owns and manages*

**Rendering:**
- *How it looks*

---

## 6) CORE SYSTEM B
*Replace with the name of your second major system (e.g. "Obstacle System", "Enemy System")*

**Types:**
- *Variants within this system*

**Spawn/generation rules:**
- *How content is created*

**Interaction rules:**
- *How the player interacts with it*

---

## 7) DIFFICULTY / PROGRESSION
*How does challenge increase? What knobs control pacing?*

---

## 8) SCORING
*What earns points? What multipliers exist? How is score clarity maintained?*

---

## 9) PERSISTENCE & SOCIAL
*Saves, leaderboards, seeds, seasons, sharing — anything that persists beyond a single run.*

---

## 10) UI / UX
**Screens:**
- *List every screen (boot, title, gameplay HUD, death, settings, etc.)*

**UX rules:**
- *Core UX principles (e.g. instant restart, minimal menus)*

---

## 11) VISUAL STYLE
*Art direction, effects, mood, color palette, motion language.*

---

## 12) AUDIO
*Music approach, SFX philosophy, how audio ties to gameplay.*

---

## 13) PERFORMANCE RULES
*Technical constraints (FPS target, pooling, allocation rules, etc.)*

---

## 14) MILESTONES
*Ordered build phases. Each milestone should be independently testable.*

1. *Phase 1 — description*
2. *Phase 2 — description*
3. *...*

---

## 15) ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
*How do we know we're done? Checkboxes for the minimum shippable product.*

- [ ] *Criteria 1*
- [ ] *Criteria 2*
- [ ] *...*
